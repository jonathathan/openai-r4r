'''
OpenAI Request for Research: Cartpole

Implements a simple linear model. Generates 10k random models and evaluates
each on a small number of episodes. Chooses the model that performs best and
tests it on 100 episodes.

Notes:
  - model params are chosen from a uniform random distribution [-1, 1)
  - the first model to last 200 steps on 20 consecutive episodes (a perfect
    validation score) is chosen as the winner, so in practice fewer than 10k
    models are generated.
